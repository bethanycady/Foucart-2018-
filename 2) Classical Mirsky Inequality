#Classical Mirksy Inequality - Foucart (2018)

#This module establishes the Classical Mirsky Inequality in which the paper relies. 
#The inequality states that for complex square matrices X, Y and A = X-Y, 
#the sum of the differences of indexed singular values of X and Y is less than or equal 
#to the sum of singular values of A.
